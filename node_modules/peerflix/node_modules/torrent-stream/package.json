  "readme": "# torrent-stream\n\nThe streaming torrent engine that [peerflix](https://github.com/mafintosh/peerflix) uses\n\n\tnpm install torrent-stream\n\n## How can I help?\n\n1. Open issues on things that are broken\n2. Fix open issues by sending PRs\n3. Add documentation\n\n## Usage\n\ntorrent-stream is a node module that allows you to access files inside a torrent as node streams.\n\n``` js\nvar torrentStream = require('torrent-stream');\nvar fs = require('fs');\n\nvar engine = torrentStream(fs.readFileSync('my-test-file.torrent'));\n\nengine.files.forEach(function(file) {\n\tconsole.log('filename:', file.name);\n\tvar stream = file.createReadStream();\n\t// stream is readable stream to containing the file content\n});\n```\n\nYou can pass `start` and `end` options to stream to slice the file\n\n``` js\n// get a stream containing bytes 10-100 inclusive.\nvar stream = file.createReadStream({\n\tstart: 10,\n\tend: 100\n});\n```\n\nPer default no files are downloaded unless you create a stream to them.\nIf you want to fetch a file anyway use the `file.select` and `file.deselect` method.\n\nWhen you start torrent-stream it will connect to the torrent dht\nand fetch pieces according to the streams you create.\n\n## Full API\n\n#### `engine = torrentStream(opts)`\n\nCreate a new engine instance. Options can contain the following\n\n``` js\n{\n\tconnections: 100,      // Max amount of peers to be connected to.\n\tpath: '/tmp/my-file', // Where to save the buffer data.\n\tdht: true             // Whether or to use the dht to find peers.\n\t                      // Defaults to true\n}\n```\n\n#### `engine.verify(cb)`\n\nVerify the currently saved data before starting the swarm.\nYou should call this as the first method if you want to persist data.\n\n#### `engine.files[...]`\n\nAn array of all files in the torrent. See the file section for more info on what methods the file has\n\n#### `engine.destroy(cb)`\n\nDestroy the engine (including the saved data) completely. The callback is optional\n\n#### `engine.listen([port], cb)`\n\nListen for incoming peers on the specified port. Port defaults to `6881`\n\n#### `engine.swarm`\n\nThe attached [peer-wire-swarm](https:/github.com/mafintosh/peer-wire-swarm) instance\n\n#### `file = engine.files[...]`\n\nA file in the torrent. They contains the following data\n\n``` js\n{\n\tname: 'my-filename.txt',\n\tpath: 'my-folder/my-filename.txt',\n\tlength: 424242\n}\n```\n\n#### `file.select()`\n\nSelects the file to be downloaded, but at a lower priority than streams.\nUseful if you know you need the file at a later stage.\n\n#### `file.deselect()`\n\nDeselects the file which means it won't be downloaded unless someone creates a stream to it\n\n#### `stream = file.createReadStream(opts)`\n\nCreate a readable stream to the file. Pieces needed by the stream will be prioritized highly.\nOptions can contain the following\n\n``` js\n{\n\tstart: startByte,\n\tend: endByte\n}\n```\n\nBoth `start` and `end` are inclusive\n\n## License\n\nMIT",
